# Laser Chess

This project was created for my high school AP Computer Science A course.
It is intended to implement the rules of [ThinkFun's Laser Chessâ„¢](https://www.thinkfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/LaserCh-1034-Instructions.pdf).

The game is playable but requires some adaptation of src/laserchess/Main.java:main.
All moves are executed at runtime. The program is not responsive to new moves while running.

The board is displayed after any valid move in the terminal, but requires UTF-8 encoding for proper visibility.
